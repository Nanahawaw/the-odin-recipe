# The-odin-recipe

This project is a part of the curriculum provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It's designed to test and showcase the skills students have acquired in HTML and CSS. 

## Objective

The primary goal of this assignment is to create a simple website, using foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS, to present recipes. This not only helps in solidifying one's understanding of the basic web development concepts but also demonstrates the ability to structure content in an organized and visually appealing manner.

## Features

- **Simple and Clean UI:** The website boasts a minimalist design that focuses on the recipes, making it easy for users to navigate and find what they're looking for.
  
- **Three Detailed Recipes:** The site offers three distinct recipes, each presented with its list of ingredients, step-by-step preparation instructions, and a final image of the dish.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
The-odin-recipe/
|-- index.html           # Main entry point
|-- recipe1.html         # First recipe
|-- recipe2.html         # Second recipe
|-- recipe3.html         # Third recipe
|-- assets/              # Contains all the images, stylesheets, etc.
    |-- images/          
    |-- styles/
        |-- main.css     # Main styling file
